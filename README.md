# Slice Rename
Slice an image and give each slice a specific name.

# Configuration
See the example which is located at `spec/fixtures/config_example.yml`. The
suffixes aren't mandatory, if you skip them or don't provide enough it will use
an auto generated suffix instead (`_00`).

The sample image is part of duty free asset pack from
